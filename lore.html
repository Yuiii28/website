        </div>
        <p>Before entering the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol, Brimstone used to work various military-type jobs, such as being a 
          firefighter in BFD (Baltimore Fire Department), working at Engine 8, and even taking part in the Special 
          Forces. As the commander he is now, it seems like he used to lead a Special Forces group called Ragged Ravens 
          with his Vandal. This is where Brimstone’s friend comes into play. The images of Brimstone always being with a 
          friend in his office pictures show he used to have close bonds with a childhood friend throughout his life. In 
          his dossier, we learn this missing friend’s name: Tariq Porter. Tariq seems to have probably died on 
          the battlefield with Brimstone, and in Brimstone’s agent player card in the game, we can see him carrying his 
          buddy Tariq. The dossier goes further to mention how Brimstone broke Tariq’s death to Sumaira, probably Tariq’s 
          wife.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Before becoming a <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> agent, Viper was a compassionate chemist who researched Radianite and Radiants 
          while potentially working for the Kingdom Corporation. A traumatic event stripped her of everything, 
          resulting in a dramatic shift in her personality, turning her into a sadistic and vengeful individual. 
          She harnessed her knowledge to create deadly chemical devices, seeking revenge on those she blames for 
          her past suffering, particularly the Earth 2 attackers. Now, as a <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> agent, Viper relishes in missions, 
          protecting her home, and inflicting suffering on her opponents, driven by her desire for vengeance and the 
          enjoyment of their pain.</p>

        <p>Omen is a phantom of a man with mysterious origins and many names. He has a limited memory of his past, though 
          he does remember being involved in something that caused him to be ripped apart and killed. All he knows that 
          links to who he used to be is a place known as Point Light, a past friendship with Sabine "Viper" Callas, and 
          feelings of restoration with every kill he makes. Contributing to the formation of the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol, Omen 
          would go on to become its third recruit and serve as one of its more experienced agents, all while he continues 
          his search for answers about what truly happened to him over a decade ago.</p>

          Amir El Amari, known as "Cypher," hails from Rabat, Morocco, where he experienced poverty and harbored resentment 
          towards the resource-draining activities of the Kingdom Corporation in his city. As an information broker, he's an 
          expert at gathering intel but is incredibly secretive, guarding his own secrets and identity zealously. To 
          maintain anonymity, he's established multiple safehouses and consistently conceals his face with a black mask. 
          Even after joining the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol, Cypher refuses to reveal his true identity, believing that no 
          information is worth the risk of unmasking himself, not even to those closest to him.</p>

          archer who became an agent for the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol as its sixth recruit, "Sova". With his right eye replaced 
          with a mechanical one after he lost it, Sova primarily serves as the team's scout, gathering information and 
          searching for targets using olden methods should technology come up short. Being highly capable and reliable 
          both in the field and with his work, whilst also having experience with multiple radianite-related events 
          (having traveled through a rift and having met his Omega counterpart), Sova has earned a reputation of being 
          one of the Protocol's most trusted agents, especially to the organization's commander, Brimstone.</p>

        <p>Jamie Adeyemi is a radiant hailing from the Peckham district in London, England. Growing up, Adeyemi attended a 
          Performing Arts school in the area but was later suspended. Recruited into the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol as its ninth 
          agent, "Phoenix", Adeyemi was heavily involved with the Protocol's activities from 10 AFL onwards. With much 
          information kept from him as need-to-know as a recent recruit, he was unable to prevent a spike detonation in 
          Venice whilst on a solo mission. Phoenix was given another opportunity to stop one the next day when another 
          attack occurred in Rabat, and it was here that he first came face-to-face with the sole perpetrator, his own 
          Omega counterpart. Frustrated with how much was being kept in the dark, despite going on to prevent the 
          detonation this time with the help of a team, Phoenix was finally filled in on the threat posed by Omega Earth.</p>

        <p>Han Sunwoo, known as "Jett," originates from South Korea and had a previous life as a chef. An incident involving 
          her radiant powers, causing a destructive storm at her restaurant, forced her to flee. Later recruited as the 
          tenth agent by the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol, Jett found herself falsely implicated in a destructive mission in Venice, 
          despite her innocence. Authorities pursued her, believing she posed a threat, leaving her unable to explain the 
          truth to those who knew her outside <span class="custom">VALORANT</span>. It was later revealed that her doppelgänger, a mirror version from 
          another Earth, was responsible, exonerating Jett of wrongdoing. However, constrained by Protocol secrecy and the 
          public's lack of understanding about alternate realities, she remains perceived as a dangerous radiant by the rest

          her tools staining the plots as a testament to her victories. Hired since then to work for the <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> Protocol 
          as its twelfth agent, "Raze", Alves now sows her chaos against bigger threats to Earth. However, as the paint

          mechanical arms for himself. His notorious criminal endeavors eventually forced him into exile, where he crossed 
          paths with Brazilian Tayane Alves, who upgraded his arms significantly. When approached to become a <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> agent,
           Torsten accepted the offer, leaving his criminal life behind and becoming "Breach," the Protocol's thirteenth 
           agent. Despite his more dignified actions, the consequences of his criminal past continue to haunt him,
