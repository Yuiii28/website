        <div class="card-image duelist"></div>
        <h2 class="rolename">DUELIST</h2>
        <p>In <span class="custom">VALORANT</span>, the Duelist role is one of the key roles within a team composition. Duelists are 
          typically aggressive and self-sufficient agents whose primary objective is to secure eliminations 
          (kills) and create openings for their team. They are often at the forefront of engagements and excel 
          in one-on-one combat situations.</p>
        <p>Examples of Duelist agents in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> include Jett, Reyna, Phoenix, Neon, Yoru and Raze. It's important to 
          note that while Duelists excel at securing kills, a balanced team composition in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> typically 
          includes a mix of roles to cover different aspects of the game, such as Controllers for map control, 
          Initiators for disrupting opponents, and Sentinels for defense. The effectiveness of a Duelist often 
          depends on the player's aim, positioning, and decision-making, as they are the front line of attack 
          for the team.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image initiator"></div>
        <h2 class="rolename">Initiator</h2>
        <p>In <span class="custom">VALORANT</span>, the Initiator role is one of the key roles within a team composition. Initiators are typically aggressive agents whose primary objective is to initiate or kickstart engagements, disrupt opponents, and create opportunities for their team to push forward or secure kills.</p>
        <p>Examples of Initiator agents in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> include Breach, Sova, Kay/O, Fade, Gekko and Skye. Initiators are essential for creating chaos and disrupting the opponent's plans, allowing their teammates, especially Duelists and Controllers, to capitalize on the confusion and secure kills. A balanced team composition typically includes a mix of roles to cover different aspects of the game, and Initiators play a critical role in initiating and leading team engagements.</p>

    <section class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image sentinel"></div>
        <h2 class="rolename">Sentinel</h2>
        <p>In <span class="custom">VALORANT</span>, the Sentinel role is one of the key roles within a team composition. Sentinels are typically defensive-minded agents whose primary objective is to hold positions, gather information, and provide utility to control and secure areas of the map.</p>
        <p>Examples of Sentinel agents in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> include Sage, Cypher, Killjoy, and Chamber. Sentinels play a crucial role in maintaining map control and preventing enemy advancements. Their abilities are designed to complement a team's overall strategy by providing information and creating obstacles for the opposition. While Sentinels are primarily defensive in nature, a balanced team composition in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> typically includes a mix of roles to cover different aspects of the game, such as Duelists for offense, Controllers for map control, and Initiators for disrupting opponents.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <div class="card-image controller"></div>
        <h2 class="rolename">Controller</h2>
        <p>In <span class="custom">VALORANT</span>, the Controller role is one of the key roles within a team composition. Controllers are typically agents whose primary objective is to control and manipulate the battlefield, particularly through the use of area-denial and crowd-control abilities. They excel at zoning, obstructing enemy movements, and establishing map control.</p>
        <p>Examples of Controller agents in <span class="custom">VALORANT</span> include Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Harbor, and Astra. Controllers are vital for shaping the flow of a match, controlling key areas, and disrupting enemy strategies. They work in tandem with other roles on the team, such as Duelists and Initiators, who capitalize on the control and space created by Controllers. A balanced team composition typically includes a mix of roles to cover different aspects of the game, and Controllers are essential for maintaining map control and manipulating the battlefield to their team's advantage.</p>
