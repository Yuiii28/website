        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Valorant is a popular tactical first-person shooter (FPS) game developed and published by Riot Games, 
          the same company behind the highly successful League of Legends. Valorant was officially released on June 2, 
          2020, and it quickly gained a large and dedicated player base. Valorant is primarily a 5v5 team-based game. Two 
          teams, Attackers and Defenders, compete against each other in a series of rounds on various maps. The game focuses 
          on strategy, coordination, and precise aiming skills. The primary objective varies based on your team's role:</p>

          </ul>
        <h2>Gameplay and Objectives</h2>
        <p>Valorant is a tactical FPS that revolves around two teams of five players each. The game is typically played in 
          a series of rounds, with one team taking on the role of Attackers and the other as Defenders. The primary 
          objective for the Attackers is to plant the Spike (a device) at a designated bomb site, while the Defenders 
          aim to prevent this by either eliminating the Attackers or defusing the Spike if it's planted.</p>

          </ul>
          <h2>Agents and Abilities</h2>
          <p>One of Valorant's defining features is its roster of Agents, each with a unique set of abilities. These abilities are divided into four 
            categories:</p>
            <ul class="skilllist">
              <li><strong>Basic Abilities (C, Q, E):</strong>  These are utility abilities that can be purchased at the beginning of each round using in-game currency. 
                They often provide tactical advantages, such as smokescreens, healing, reconnaissance tools, or area denial.</li>
              <li><strong>Signature Ability (F):</strong> This ability is unique to each Agent and doesn't require purchase. It is often a core aspect of an Agent's 
                playstyle.</li>
              <li><strong>Ultimate Ability (X):</strong> The Ultimate Ability is the most powerful ability an Agent possesses. It charges over time and with kills and 
                can have game-changing effects.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The combination of gunplay and Agent abilities adds strategic depth to Valorant, as teams need to coordinate their Agent selections 
            and abilities to maximize their chances of victory.</p>
